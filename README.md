# Lazerus



## ðŸŽ® About the Game
Lazerus is a 3D low poly game that takes place inside of a sphere. This project was for a Video Game Design Club at Augusta University, where we were given a month to solo develop a game by ourselves. All the assets were from the Unity Asset store. 
This repo is used as an archive of this project.

The main goal was to make it a rouge-like where the player get stronger as the level goes on. The controls are using the Mouse to move in the environment and using the Left-Mouse Button to Attack. Right now, the game does not have a playable build so you would have to play it from Scene View
